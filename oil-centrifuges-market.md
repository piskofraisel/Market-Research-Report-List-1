<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil Centrifuges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Swinging-bucket Rotors</li><li>Fixed-angle Rotors</li><li>Vertical Rotors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oil centrifuges market is segmented into three main types: swinging-bucket rotors, fixed-angle rotors, and vertical rotors. </p><p>Swinging-bucket rotors allow for a gentle, effective separation by oscillating the buckets, which enhances sedimentation. Fixed-angle rotors maintain a constant angle, promoting faster separation but may generate more shear forces. Vertical rotors optimize sedimentation by using gravity more effectively, suitable for high-density separations. Each type serves specialized applications across various industries, influencing efficiency, throughput, and product purity.</p></p>

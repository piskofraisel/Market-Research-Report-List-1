<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heating and Cooling Circulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop</li><li>Closed Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heating and cooling circulator market is primarily divided into two types: open loop and closed loop systems. Open loop systems draw fluid directly from a source, such as a lake or river, for heating or cooling and then discharge it back, suitable for applications where water quality is not critical. Closed loop systems, conversely, recirculate a predetermined volume of fluid within a sealed circuit, making them ideal for precise temperature control and applications requiring minimal contamination.</p></p>
